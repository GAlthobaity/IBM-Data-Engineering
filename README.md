# IBM-Data-Engineering
This repository contains all projects done through the [IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-engineer).


[ETL Project](https://github.com/UnknownBonita/IBM-Data-Engineering/blob/main/ETL.ipynb):
This project is part of [Python Project for Data Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-engineering) course from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

I performed the role of a Data Engineer and extracted data from multiple file formats (by implementing webscraping and extracting data with APIs), transformed it into specific data types, and then loaded it into a single source for analysis.
